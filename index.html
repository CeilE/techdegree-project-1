        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I was once a guy who has always been in his comfort zone, not stepping up the game. I missed a big opportunity given to me before, an opportunity that will definitely change my life. After a few years, I became matured, I started to realize that I should step up the game. Now, I am given another opportunity that will change my life forever for good, and I'm not going to miss it! I'm gonna get it! Thanks to treehouse.</p>
        <p>I worked at Mcdonald's before in the Philippines, studied until I finish senior high school, and now I'm studying front end web development with the best team in the world.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>My goal is to be a great programmer, be an expert on many and eventually all computer languages. Not just that, I want to step up the game more and be great at everything in a very young age. My favorite computer languages and the languages that I first want to be expert with are:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I want to use my knowledge in programming when I build my own company. I thought it would be very useful in this information age.</p>
